# mysales-app
This is simple sales app with a list of products.

* When you click on product checkbox, the PRICE will be displayed; and as you input QUANTITY, the COST of the product will be computed for you automatically. The COST is the product of QUANTITY * PRICE.

* Else, if you try to input a QUANTITY without "checking" the PRICE, you'll receive an alert reminding you that "Price cannot be empty 🙄 !"

* When you're done checking products, inputing quantities, and viewing the costs, you needn't bother stressing your brain for the total costs and quantities, just move over to the TOTALS section 🏃‍♂️ 🏃‍♂️ 🏃‍♂️ .

* At the TOTALS section, click on the "items" button, and the TOTAL number of items you selected will be calculated for you. Likewise cost, click on the "cost" button, and the TOTAL COST of the costs of the items selected will be calculated automatically.

* You can RESET/REFRESH the App when you're done with your activities there.

* The page is RESPONSIVE. Hence, you can resize your browser to see the different styles.
